  {
    "name": "Dousan",
    "description": "They are experts at navigating the Crystal Desert, dressed for travel and the constant heat of the three suns. The Dousan can be more focused on the afterlife than their living life and so can be immaterial and simplistic in their habits and lifestyles. The Dousan think of themselves as more profound and spiritually aware than other clans. Others can find the Dousan morbid and creepy."

  {
    "name": "Spriton",
    "description": "Renowned for their knowledge of the soil and agricultural methods. The Spriton are also skilled at artisanal crafts, such as stitching, fabric and textile working, and beading. Most folk get on well with the Spriton, as their humble and friendly demeanor make other Gelfling feel at home."

  {
    "name": "Stonewood",
    "description": "Their occupations, aside from the warrior life and Crystal Castle Guard, would probably include woodworking, stone masonry, and building. They are hard-working, proud, and a bit rowdy. The Stonewood think of themselves as tougher and more resilient than the other clans. Other clans find the Stonewood arrogant and aggressive."

  {
    "name": "Grottan",
    "description": "The entire Grottan clan has recently been forced above the surface by the darkening making their underground home unlivable. The bright light of the three suns hurts their large, dark eyes, which are adapted to living in near and total darkness. They have also evolved to have slightly larger ears, and are ghostly pale with white-blond hair. Often dirty, they don�t wear nice things - but they don�t mind. A happy if slightly odd bunch."
  },
  {
    "name": "Vapran",
    "description": "The Vapra enjoy relative prestige among the Gelfling clans, though some resent their superior attitudes. Their access to the minerals and metals found within the Silver Sea cliffs have made them artisans and scholars."

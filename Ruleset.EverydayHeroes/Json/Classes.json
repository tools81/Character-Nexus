    "description": "People think you are charming, useful, and mostly harmless. That's exactly what you want people to think. In reality, you have everyone dancing on your strings to whatever tune you want to play for them.<br />The manipulator focuses on weakening or controlling opponents in a fight and rarely makes attacks. With the right allies, these are powerful abilities. They also have the strongest set of social skills for any hero and shine in noncombat situations.",

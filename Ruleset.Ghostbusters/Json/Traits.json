Very smart people (Brains 5 or more) can do calculus in their heads, write computer programs which work the first time they run, and speak foreign languages like a native. Bozos like to watch Lost in Space reruns on TV.<br />In GHOSTBUSTERS, unlike real life, all smart folks know lots about lots of things. If your Ghostbuster has a high Brains Trait, he knows a lot about history, biology, chemistry, physics, linguistics, trivia, and the occult. A character's Brains Talent simply determines what his particular specialty is.",

With a Cool 7, you maintain your pace, even if you show up at a black-tie ball in a chicken suit. On the other hand, a Ghostbuster with Cool 1 calls the FBI when his toilet backs up.",

Most of these creatures on Earth display spiderlike powers.<br />When a character bonds with a symbiote, they go up one rank and gain the listed tags, traits, and powers. Any remaining powers they select are often from the Spider-Powers set but do not have to be. Many symbiotes have the Disguise power.<br />If the symbiote is Venom or one of its progeny, Spider-Man (Peter Parker) cannot gain any benefits from his Spider-Sense power against the bonded character.",

Often, they had the latent genetic potential to develop powers and were somehow exposed to the right triggers - which would have likely killed most other people.<br />These kinds of character are sometimes call mutates. The difference between a mutate and a mutant is that a mutant's powers come to them naturally, but a mutate's powers require a triggering incident that might never happen. In this sense, Inhumans are all mutates who share a gene with a known rigger: the Terrigen Mist.",

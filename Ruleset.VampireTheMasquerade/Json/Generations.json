The more recent the Embrace, the more likely the characters are to be thinbloods of the 14th, 15th, or 16th Generation. However, new childer of the 12th and 13th Generation remain plausible even tonight.",

    "description": "Embraced between the American Revolution and World War II, under 250 years old. An ancilla came of age during the modern era or at least in an era when the divine right of princes were becoming an eccentric joke instead of the foundation of society. It was the contrast between their relative modernity and the medieval mindset of the Camarilla that led to the rise of the Anarch Movement. Even hard-line Camarilla ancillae believe the system should loosen up – which other Kindred interpret to mean 'give us more power.' Ancilla characters can be as low as 10th or 11th Generation.",
